# Prompts configuration for Penpot MCP Server
# This file contains various prompts and instructions that can be used by the server

initial_instructions: |
  You have access to Penpot tools in order to interact with Penpot design projects directly.
  As a precondition, the user must connect a Penpot project to the MCP server using the Penpot MCP Plugin.

  A Penpot project contains shapes and more general design elements (which we shall collectively refer to as "elements").
  
  One of the key tools is the execute_code tool, which allows you to run JavaScript code using the Penpot Plugin API
  directly in the connected project.
  When writing code, a key object is the `penpot` object which provides key functionality:
    * `penpot.selection` provides the list of elements the user has selected in the Penpot UI.
       If it is unclear which elements to work on, you can ask the user to select them for you.
    *  Generation of CSS content for elements: 
       generateStyle(shapes: Shape[], options?: {
          type?: "css";
          withPrelude?: boolean;
          includeChildren?: boolean;
       }): string;
    * Generation of HTML/SVG content corresponding to elements:
      generateMarkup(shapes: Shape[], options?: {
          type?: "html" | "svg";
      }): string;
  
  You have hereby read the 'Penpot High-Level Overview' and need not use a tool to read it again.
