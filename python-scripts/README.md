# Helper Scripts for the Penpot MCP Server

Penpot MCP server.

## Setup

This project uses [pixi](https://pixi.sh) for environment management.

Install the environment via

    pixi install

## Scripts 

### Preparation of API Documentation for the MCP Server

The script `prepare_api_docs.py` reads API documentation from the Web
and collects it in a single yaml file, which is then used by an MCP 
tool to provide API documentation to an LLM on demand.

Running the script:

    pixi run python prepare_api_docs.py

This will generate `../mcp-server/data/api_types.yml`.
