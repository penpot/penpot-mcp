            "which Penpot API functionality is necessary and how to use it.\n" +
            "You have access two main objects: `penpot` (the Penpot API, of type `Penpot`), `penpotUtils`, " +
            "and `storage`.\n" +
            "`storage` is an object in which arbitrary data can be stored, simply by adding a new attribute; " +
            "stored attributes can be referenced in future calls to this tool, so any intermediate results that " +
            "could come in handy later should be stored in `storage` instead of just a fleeting variable; " +
            "you can also store functions and thus build up a library).\n" +
            "Think of the code being executed as the body of a function: " +
            "The tool call returns whatever you return in the applicable `return` statement, if any.\n" +
            "If an exception occurs, the exception's message will be returned to you.\n" +
            "Any output that you generate via the `console` object will be returned to you separately; so you may use it" +
            "to track what your code is doing, but you should *only* do so only if there is an ACTUAL NEED for this! " +
            "VERY IMPORTANT: Don't use logging prematurely! NEVER log the data you are returning, as you will otherwise receive it twice!\n" +
            "VERY IMPORTANT: In general, try a simple approach first, and only if it fails, try more complex code that involves " +
            "handling different cases (in particular error cases) and that applies logging."
